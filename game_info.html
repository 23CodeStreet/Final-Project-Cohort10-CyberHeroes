      Internet Island needs your help! Do you think you have what it takes to be a Cyber Hero? Put your
      super powers to the test as you compete against your friends to earn the most common-cents and
      rid the island of dangers. But be careful out there, not everyone on the island can be trusted. Always
      remember that a true cyber hero must be both brave and kind.

      Cyber Heroes is a game designed to teach school children the importance of privacy and internet
      safeguarding measures. It covers a range of topics surrounding social media and the security of
      personal data through a series of gamified scenarios in which the player will be taught how to
      conduct themselves safely in an online environment. Some of the topics covered include cyber
      bullying, stranger danger, age restricted websites, social media, and peer pressure.
      Cyber Heroes is designed to be fun and lighthearted while still taking the issue of cyber safety
      seriously. We have taken care to ensure that children will not feel frightened or threatened while
      playing the game. Instead players will enjoy overcoming the challenges and competing against their
      friends to save Internet Island. At the end the players who have collected the most common-cents
      will appear on our in-game leaderboard.
      <br>
      <br>
      We wish all the safety savvy superheroes out there, young or old, the very best on their quest to
      save the island and we hope you enjoy the experience.
